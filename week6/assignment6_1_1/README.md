Exercise 1:

- Create a header file that contains definition for enum class "status", and add a
success status, and couple of error statuses
- Create a function that returns a status code at random
- Create a program to call the function and handle the status using `switch`-statement
 

Exercise 2:

We are going to implement a simple state machine.  A state machine is pretty simple concept
with a lot of complicated explanations, but let's keep it simple here.

We create a state machine to track a status of an order (e.g. from an online store).  The order
should be tracked from ordered to delivered.  (Make up the intermediate states)

- Create a type to track the state for the machine.  Use `enum class`
- Create a type for the orders (this is our state machine).  Add a member functions to print the current status and to advance the status of the order.
Create a program that runs through the different states and prints and advances through them.
