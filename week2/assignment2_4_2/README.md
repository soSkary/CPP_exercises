Modbus communication

Modbus is a communication protocol for connecting electronic devices, allowing them to exchange data and be controlled by a central computer. 

In this exercise you are going to simulate a simple Modbus communication between one master device and a 10 slave devices. All the data will be stored in and read from files.

Exercise 1:

Every device has an unique id, is it master or slave device, and each slave device has a data register with the register address and a value for the register.

Start by creating a program that generates the devices and stores them in a file called devices.csv (comma separated values) and another file called registers.csv that will store the slave devices id, register address and value.

Exercise 2:

Your program will simulate the master device reading a register from a slave device. Specify the slave device id, and register number, the program will then read the correct device and register, and print the register value.

Exercise 3:

Simulate the master writing a value into a slave device's register. Specify the id, register address and the new value. The program should update the value in the "register.txt" file.
