Exercise 1:

Write a program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using std::sort

Exercise 2:

Use std::sort with std::greater<int>() to sort an array of integers in descending order.

Exercise 3:

Create a vector of floating-point numbers and sort it. Experiment with different sizes of vectors and number ranges.

Exercise 4:

Create a vector of strings and sort them in lexicographical order. Also, sort them based on the string length.

Exercise 5:
Create a vector of pairs where each pair contains a string and an integer (like a name and an age). Sort the vector based on the integer.

Exercise 6:

Use std::partial_sort to find the top 5 elements from a vector of integers. The vector should have at least 20 elements.

Exercise 7:

Create a vector of pairs with repeating first elements. After sorting, check if the pairs with equal first elements maintain their relative order.
