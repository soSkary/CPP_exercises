Exercise 1

In exercise 6.1.2 we created a tagged union of our own.  Reimplement the same using a std::variant instead.  Use full name instead of the initial this time around.


Exercise 2

In Ex. 7.4.1 we created a animals using virtual inheritance.  Recreate the same animals without using virtual, and then create a std::variant of the animals and fill a vector with those.

Look at documentation of std::visit, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/visit

Using the void visitor, call the demonstration function of each animal entry.
Using one of the type-matching visitors, print some text relating to the animal matched
