Exercise 1.

Create a template class and overload its equality operator.

The overridden operator should `static_cast` its arguments to a type given as a 
template parameter and do the comparison.

 

Exercise 2.

Create a new type of your own choosing, and use CRTP to give it the equality comparison
functionality from the result of exercise 1.

(Optional) Add other comparisons, (e.g. >, !=, >=, <=) as well with the exercise 1 class. 

Exercise 3

Create another template class and give it a function to print out its type 
(e.g. by using typeid or some simple checker with type_traits, no need to handle everything).
Then inherit both this functionality and the functionality created in ex 1. to your type.
