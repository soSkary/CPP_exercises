Often needed container type is a 2D grid (you might've noticed already).  We are going
to create a standard library-compatible container for such an use case during the week.

Look through https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container You don't
need to understand everything yet (and you can completely ignore the complexity).


Exercise 1

Create a template class for the grid.  Think about the template parameters it should have.

Look at "Types" under the requirements found in the Container specification.  Create type
aliases for those for your grid class.  Think what for example size_type should be here?

In addition to that, we want a storage_type defined, which will be the type of the actual
storage we use. (e.g. an std::vector)

 
Exercise 1.5

It is useful to create helper types if you did not do so already.  Create types representing
the dimensions of the grid (i.e. width & height) and position on the grid.


Exercise 2

Implement accessing a grid element.  You'll need to calculate the index postion to the
internal memory buffer for this.  Typically this is done by overloading the operator()or
providing function at(), but C++23 finally allows using multidimensional subscript operator
as well (operator[]), use whatever you prefer (or do all if you want!).

Implement a way to print the contents of the grid to the terminal.


Exercise 3

Implement begin() and end(),  and their const-overloads.

 

Exercise 4

Implement getting the current grid size, and optionally resizing the grid

 

At this point you should alrady have quite an useful grid type.  Feel
free to improve on it yourself, or try out how standard algorithms work
with it at this point.

 

(optional, should only do this if you plan to use your grid type later)
Exercise 5

Use doctest to implement unit tests for your grid type, and implement
the remaining Container requirements.
