Exercise 1.

Here we will create an interface for an UI element (these are usually called widgets).  
It should have require functionality such as reacting to user actions "on_click()", "on_focus()", etc.  
In addition it should have a way to move and get position of the UI element.  
In addition, UI elements usually have child elements (that also fulfill the interface), 
you should require functionality to add / remove / list those as well.

 

Exercise 2.

Make some mock class that inherits the interface.  
It does not need to be a real UI or anything, 
just something that implements the UI interface.
