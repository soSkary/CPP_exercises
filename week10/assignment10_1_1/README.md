Exercise 1

From the main thread, create two threads, one of which prints "Hello, " and the other "world!\n".

Run your program a couple of times.

 

Exercise 2

Create a function that adds an integer n times to a static global variable.  e.g. void add(int increment int times);  Use a loop to do the increments.

Create 100 threads from the main() function to call the add-function.

Compare the result to straight-up calculation.

 

Exercise 3

Repeat exercise 2, but use mutexes to lock the summation so only one thread can do the increment at a time (check out std::lock_guard as well)

 

Exercise 4

Repeat exercise 2, but use std::atomic type as your global sum type.
