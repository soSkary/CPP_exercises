Exercise 1

Try libfmt by using your system package manager (usually the package is named fmt or libfmt).  While this library is slowly being standardised, it is useful since the standard adoption progresses quite slowly.

 

Exercise 2

Try backward-cpp (cmake instructions found behind the link), and check how e.g. assert(0) works before and after you've gotten it to work. (There should be easily notable difference)

 

Exercise 3

Try nlohmann's json library.Links to an external site.  Use it to read a json file from your hard drive and print the stored contents.  (You can use e.g. json files from https://github.com/LearnWebCode/json-example)  Then create a json file from your code and save that to your hard drive.

JSON is pretty common format to pass data around as a text.  You are bound to run into it so this is quite useful (and commonly used) library for the task.
