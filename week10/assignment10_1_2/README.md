It is common to separate input thread from functionality, let's see a bit how that works.

 

Exercise 1

Create a log, a vector of strings is a decent choice for the storage.  Knowing it will be accessed from multiple threads, think a bit how you want to handle it.

 

Create a function to read user input until user writes quit (or some other way for the user to gracefully exit) Add the read input to the log.

Create a function to add a message to the log every second.  (e.g. one second passed or program has been running for n seconds)

 

Make the program print the log if user input matches some command e.g. log

Launch both functions in separate threads, try it out.

 

Exercise 2

Implement functionality so the second loop exits gracefully if the user decided to exit.
