Exericse 1.

Test basic math functions.
First write your unit tests and then create simple math functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
Try and think about meaningful unit tests. 
Your program does not need a user interface now that you are using unit tests to check for functionality.
Remember error handling.

Exercise 2.

Write unit tests for a string utility program. 
Write unit tests that check if your program can correctly handle reversing a string, 
a method to convert a string to uppercase, 
a method to convert a string to lowercase and a method to check if a string is a palindrome.

Exercise 3.

Add unit tests to your banking program that you had built earlier. 
Try and get as high test coverage as possible.
