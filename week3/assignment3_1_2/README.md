Virtual Weather Station

Your task is to create a virtual weather station. 
The program should handle any exceptions that may occur during runtime. 

Handle various aspects like temperature, humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure.

Generate weather data via a function simulating changes in weather over time. 
Make sure the data changes in a way that's somewhat realistic. 
So the temperature should not jump from +20C to -20C

Implement exception handling. 
If data generated is out of logical range for example the temperature is less than -273.15C or humidity is over 100%. 

Log data in files. 
Handle any file-related exceptions like not being able to open the file. 

The console applications should be able to show logs and current weather. 
For testing purposes you can add a function that allows you to manually add weather readings.
