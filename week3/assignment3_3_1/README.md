Pascal's triangle

Pascal's triangle is a construction representing binomial coefficients. 
The triangle starts with a row that has a single value of 1. 
Elements of each row are constructed by summing the
numbers above, to the left and right, and treating blank entries as 0. 
Here is an example of the triangle with five rows:
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
