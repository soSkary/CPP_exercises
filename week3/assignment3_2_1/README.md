Travelling Salesperson Problem.

You have been assigned the task to plan the route of a container ship. 
The ship starts in Panama and there are four other ports. New York, Amsterdam, Helsinki and Durban. 
The ship can visit each port only once. 
The goal is to minimize the carbon emissions, which means that a shorter route is better than a longer one.

Exericse 1:

Create a recursive function that will print out all the possible routes that start from Panama.

Optional Exercise 2:

Expand your program to calculate the shortest distance.

Use the below table to calculate the shortest route.

            Panama	New York	Amsterdam	Helsinki	Durban
Panama	        0	 4,460	        8,440	    9,240	12,950
New York	4,460	     0	        5,700	    6,620	12,700
Amsterdam	8,440	 5,700	            0	    1,520	 9,760
Helsinki	9,240	 6,620	        1,520	        0	10,480
Durban	    12,950	12,700	        9,760      10,480	         0
The distance is not factual and measured, but works for this exercise.
