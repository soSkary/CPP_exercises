In our animal exercise, we couldn't create a vector of our animal objects.  
Now, with smart pointers we have tools to make this happen.

Manually create a text file that contains comma-separated an animal type (species) and it's name in every line.  e.g.
parrot, Joe
dog, Lassie
cat, Lucifer

 

Exercise 1

Create a vector of unique_ptrs to animal base class, and read the file and add the animals to the vector.  
If the animal species matches a class for the species, create a pointer to that type of animal, otherwise create a general animal pointer.

Test your program by printing the contents of the vector.

Think about why this needed to be done with virtual classes instead of using static polymorphism, 
and about the tradeoffs compared to using e.g. tagged union here.
