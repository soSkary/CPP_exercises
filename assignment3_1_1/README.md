Make programs that implement error codes or exceptions.

1. Write a program that performs a division operation. 
The user should input two numbers. 
The program should catch and handle the possibility of a division by zero error. 

2. Write a program that reads in a list of integers and finds the maximum value. 
Return an error code if the list is empty.

3. Create a program that will print out a list of names. 
The user can choose a person in the list by inputting the user index and their name gets printed out. 
If the user tries to choose a user that is outside of the index, throw an appropriate exception. 

4. Overload a function called process_data(). 
One version should accept an integer and the other a string. 
If the integer is negative or the string contains any non-alphabet characters, throw an exception.

5. Add error handling to your banking system.
